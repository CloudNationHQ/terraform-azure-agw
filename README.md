# Application Gateway

This Terraform module simplifies the deployment and management of azure application gateways, offering flexible listener, routing, and backend configurations for secure and efficient traffic handling.

## Goals

The main objective is to create a more logic data structure, achieved by combining and grouping related resources together in a complex object.

The structure of the module promotes reusability. It's intended to be a repeatable component, simplifying the process of building diverse workloads and platform accelerators consistently.

A primary goal is to utilize keys and values in the object that correspond to the REST API's structure. This enables us to carry out iterations, increasing its practical value as time goes on.

A last key goal is to separate logic from configuration in the module, thereby enhancing its scalability, ease of customization, and manageability.

## Non-Goals

These modules are not intended to be complete, ready-to-use solutions; they are designed as components for creating your own patterns.

They are not tailored for a single use case but are meant to be versatile and applicable to a range of scenarios.

Security standardization is applied at the pattern level, while the modules include default values based on best practices but do not enforce specific security standards.

End-to-end testing is not conducted on these modules, as they are individual components and do not undergo the extensive testing reserved for complete patterns or solutions.

## Features

- utilization of terratest for robust validation.
- supports multiple backend pools with flexible configurations.
- allows multiple frontend IP configurations and ports.
- supports multiple listeners per application with flexible routing rules.
- integrates multiple backend HTTP settings with probes.
- supports path based and basic routing rules.
- allows URL rewrite rules and custom header modifications.
- configures ssl certificates from key vault.
- supports autoscaling and zone redundancy.
- seamlessly associates virtual machine network interfaces with backend address pools for traffic routing.

## Notes

Using a dedicated module, we've developed a naming convention for resources that's based on specific regular expressions for each type, ensuring correct abbreviations and offering flexibility with multiple prefixes and suffixes.

Full examples detailing all usages, along with integrations with dependency modules, are located in the examples directory.

To update the module's documentation run `make doc`
